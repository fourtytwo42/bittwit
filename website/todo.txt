the owner of the nft post should get paid, they should get an automatic stake in the pool
the creator should also get a small cut but smaller than the owner if they aren't the same address

friends list and feed from friends list
top public posts
top 10 users

use the address ending in ?user=address to show users page, if that is used add a add follow button

more detailed view page for post
ability to send it on that page or react

need a page for follow feed that spreads out the most recent posts of the people you follow

it looks like your stake is tied to the address in the address bar 

Register username should be at the top where the username is. Dont collect nft at registration. Put a button on every post they own to set as avatar. Use placeholder image until then.
