Silverbacks Lounge: A Blockchain-Powered Social Media Platform
Welcome to Silverbacks Lounge, the revolutionary social media platform that integrates blockchain technology to redefine online interactions and content monetization. Built for the Ethereum network and leveraging the power of Dalle3 for AI-generated content, Silverbacks Lounge offers a unique space where every post is not just a form of expression but also an investment and an asset.

Features
Decentralized Posting: Users can upload images or generate AI images using Dalle3, accompanied by text. Each post becomes a tradable ERC721 NFT, with authors retaining visibility and the ability to sell their NFTs.

REACT Token Voting: Posts can be upvoted or downvoted using the REACT token, an ERC20 token that functions within liquidity pools associated with each post. Investing REACT in a post grants users shares that can be redeemed for more REACT in the future, with early adopters benefiting the most.

Profit Sharing: NFT owners earn a percentage from the liquidity pools tied to their posts, creating a direct correlation between a post's popularity and its value.

Moderator DAO: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where users can stake REACT tokens to gain moderation powers, influencing user bans and post deletions for a healthy community environment.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Install MetaMask as your Ethereum wallet.
Ensure you have some ETH for transaction fees and REACT tokens for platform interaction.
Setup
Connect MetaMask: Visit Silverbacks Lounge and connect your MetaMask wallet to get started.

Register: Promptly register a username to begin your journey.

Usage
Posting
Create a Post: Navigate to the post area, where you'll find options to add text, upload an image, or generate an image using Dalle3.

Upload or Generate Image: Choose an existing image from your device or input a prompt to generate an AI image with Dalle3.

Publish: Once satisfied with your content, click 'Post'. MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction, embedding your image's URI in an ERC721 NFT on IPFS.

Interaction
Browse and Follow: Explore posts on your home feed, profile, or the discover page. Follow other users to curate your feed.

Vote: Click upvote or downvote on posts and decide how many REACT tokens to invest. Approve and confirm the transaction to contribute to the post's liquidity pool.

Liquidity Pools and Profit
Dynamics: The share-to-REACT ratio in liquidity pools worsens by 10% hourly, rewarding early contributors.

Withdrawal: Exchange your shares back to REACT at any time, potentially profiting if you invested early in popular posts.
